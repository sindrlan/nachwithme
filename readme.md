## About our project-repo
In the root directory of our repository there are various files for configuring the project, as well as for running the application in gitpod. Our source-code for our application is placed in nachwithme/src/*, where the * sign symbolizes each module we will be creating throughout the project. In the nachwithme/ directory there is also a target/ folder for compiled code, a test/ folder with subdirectories for each of the modules in the src folder. In the nachwithme/src/ there is also a Project Object Model (POM.xml) file which contains information about the project and the project configuration for the build tool (Maven).
