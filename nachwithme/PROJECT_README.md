# About the app
«Nach with Me» is an app that allows the user to get information about the location of *nachspiels*. The app saves your own address, so that if you have a nachspiel of your own you can press a button and an event with your address is available. There is also a possibility to look back at previous nachspiels you have attended, as well as previous nachspiels you have had yourself. 
(If we are implementing friendslists: ) There is a friendslist available which is alerted when you have a nachspiel, and you will be alerted in the same manner when someone on your friendslist is having a nachspiel.
